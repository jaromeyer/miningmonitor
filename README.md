# miningmonitor
A simple ESP8266 program to show Ethereum price and stats from your mining rig running on nanopool on a OLED display. I used this code as a base: https://hackaday.io/project/28610-crypto-ticker.

The files init.lua, getrates.lua and update_display.lua are the ones you have to transfer to your ESP8266 with ESPlorer. The included NodeMCU firmware is a build with everything included for it to work. Just flash it with some. nodemcuflasher
